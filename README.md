# Carry On

## Introduction
As a user
I want to be able to continue education in a curriculum format by setting goals & searching for useful links
So that my skills may improve 
And I can add/delete useful books or videos
```
```
When I open the app, I am able to sign in & by connecting to my google account
When I click on Search Books or Search Videos it will redirect me to a new page to Search for a subject
When I Search the subject it will display the results & I have the option to save the links
When I click Saved I am able to view the links I have saved in my profile & also am able to remove unwanted links
